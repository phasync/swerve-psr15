/**
 * The PSR-7 response that upgrades a request to a WebSocket: the entry of the adapter, {@see WebSocketResponse::from()}.
 *
 * The handler of the application is always given swerve's own {@see WebSocket}, the same class in
 * every framework adapter, so the examples in swerve's `docs/websocket.md` apply as they are. The
 * codec, the close codes and the limits are swerve's too.
 *
 * ```php
 * $app->get('/chat', function ($request, $response) {
 *     $user = $request->getAttribute('user');   // read the request now: the handler runs after the route returned
 *
 *     return WebSocketResponse::from($request, function (WebSocket $ws) use ($user) {
 *         foreach ($ws as $message) {
 *             $ws->send("$user: $message");
 *         }
 *     });
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * `from()` checks the handshake in the request, with swerve's own decision ({@see WebSocket::handshake()}),
 * and returns an ordinary PSR-7 response either way. A request that is no handshake gets the refusal
 * swerve itself would send (426 for a plain GET, 400 for an invalid handshake, 403 for an origin that is
 * not allowed), a plain response that middleware decorates like any other. A handshake gets a real
 * `101` response with `Upgrade`, `Connection`, `Sec-WebSocket-Accept` and the chosen
 * `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol`: middleware may add headers to it (CORS, cookies), and the clones it makes
 * keep the handler and the limit. When {@see Bridge} sends it, the connection is handed to swerve with
 * the response's headers as they are, and the handler runs.
 *
 * @see EventStreamResponse
