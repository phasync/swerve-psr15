/**
 * The `101` response's body: the outbound WebSocket frames, as a PSR-7 stream a middleware may wrap
 * around (`withBody()`) to see every byte the client is sent.
 *
 * Nothing of phasync's, and no coroutine, is touched until the first `read()`: that is when the
 * handler starts (its own coroutine, over a {@see WebSocketDuplex} on an unbuffered channel and the
 * request's body), so a middleware that replaces the `101` with another response (a `403`, say)
 * never starts it, and building the response itself ({@see WebSocketResponse::from()}) needs no
 * coroutine. `close()` ends the channel from this side, so a handler mid-send sees its write fail.
 *
 * @internal built by {@see WebSocketResponse}
